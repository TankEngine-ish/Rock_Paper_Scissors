# Rock_Paper_Scissors
My first JavaScript Project!
In the first part of the project the game was played all inside the browser's console. 

Things I've learned during the course of the project:

1. Disabling buttons.
2. Defining functions and then calling them inside another function.
3. Plenty more of CSS. My project is basically 50% CSS.
4. Working on a seperate branch. I was worried a bit when my commits weren't showing on the GitHub graph
when I worked on another branch, but after I merged it with main they all fell into place with the right dates and everything.
5. Plenty of other Javascript things which you only learn in practice, and not in theory.
6. Adding favicons.
7. The importance of  margin:0;
                      padding:0;
